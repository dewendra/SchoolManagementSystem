				<p class="paragraph-text text-justify">Indian Education - An
					education system, which once remained unrivalled, has today reached
					to the unfateful & deteriorating condition when it comes to the
					quality of it. Excluding a handful of modern & highly-expensive
					schools, a large portion of the Indian education industry suffers
					from a rotten administrative disposition and lack of conscientious
					modernisation. And address this very problem, AddWeb comes with its
					very own School Management System - SMS!</p>
					<p></p>
					<p class="paragraph-text"><b>What do current Indian Schools lack?</b></p>
				<p class="paragraph-text text-justify">
					<span style="font-weight: 400">Schools are the places, where
						the future generation is nurtured. And hence, that’s where the
						future of the nation is dependent the most upon. So, it becomes
						vital for schools to be progressive in every possible manner. But
						unfortunately, that’s the only place which lacks progressiveness
						the most.</span>
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph-text text-justify">
					<span style="font-weight: 400">A life that is otherwise
						highly surrounded by technology and varied gadgets, the majority
						of schools still doesn’t have the most basic access to gadgets
						like computers. It is imperative that a child experiences & learns
						things at schools that he can connect well with the real world.
						The drastic difference between both the worlds will leave him
						baffled sometimes. And hence, the online management system of the
						school will help them conceive and co-relate with the practical
						use of technology that might come to his use too as a grown-up. </span>
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph-text text-justify">
					<span style="font-weight: 400">Parents too feel the same
						about the operation of a school’s management, when they’ve
						otherwise adopted several technologies in their day-to-day lives.
						The dearth of technology and the ease that it provides to one,
						leave the parents with no option but to opt for those
						highly-expensive schools. Though, well equipped with modern
						technologies, these high-end schools does not economically fit
						into our country’s current economic condition. Catering only the
						cream class of the country’s overall population, these schools
						completely ignore the very purpose of spreading quality education
						to the grass-root level. </span>
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph-text text-justify">
					<span style="font-weight: 400">In such a situation, it
						becomes imperative for the privileged one to step up and do
						something within their respective capacities. And hence, AddWeb
						with its technological proficiency over technology took over the
						responsibility of creating an app that works even-handedly across
						all the schools, nationwide. AEDU is our humble attempt at
						bringing-in equality in our Indian education system through
						technology! </span>
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph-text"><b>SMS - The Ultimate Solution that’s All-Inclusive!  </b></p>
				<p class="paragraph-text text-justify">
					<span style="font-weight: 400">A solution to any
						education-related issue should never be just concentrated towards
						a certain section of society. Because the very purpose of
						education is to eliminate disparities of all kind. A lot of other
						‘elite’ schools are already breeding the idea of dividing the
						education class-wise. But the very core of AEDU is bringing in the
						all-inclusiveness, at least in the way the schools are being
						managed. </span>
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph-text text-justify">
					<span style="font-weight: 400">Right from the administrative
						department to the fees management department, teacher’s task
						management, updates received by the parents, et al are all brought
						together on the same page and in a more structured manner with
						this school management system. AEDU is the ultimate software for
						managing the schools, which isn’t restricted to just one group of
						schools but is designed to be used across schools from various
						parts of the world. </span>
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph-text text-justify">
					<span style="font-weight: 400">AEDU is a software that is
						also backed with three mobile applications viz. Driver’s App for
						tracking the kids’ school bus route and Parents App for sending
						across updates and accelerating the communication between the
						school and the parents. These on-the-go apps perfectly suit the
						current lifestyle of working parents and hence works as a boon to
						them for taking care of their school-going kids. Similarly, AEDU
						also has a Teacher’s App for simplifying the administrative job of
						a teacher and sparing them more time & energy for focusing on the
						core of teaching. </span>
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph-text text-justify">
					<span style="font-weight: 400">Accustomed to ‘Talk
						Solution’, AddWeb had since long been the witness of this very
						issue faced by the Indian education system. Being a mere IT
						Company, changing the entire education system wasn’t in our hands.
						But aiding the schools with a FREE school management system was
						surely within our capacity. And thus, AEDU - AddWeb Education
						Management System was created. So, if you too feel like adopting
						this modern way of managing the school with this school management
						system of ours, feel free to get in touch with us here.</span>
